# MUT 26 Auction Snipe Station

A lightweight prototype tab for tracking and planning MUT 26 auction snipes. The interface runs entirely client-side—open `index.html` in a browser to explore filters, timers, and the planner form for adding new targets.

## Features
- Search and filter live-looking listings by name, BIN, overall rating, position, team chemistry, and time window.
- Auto-snipe toggle that instantly claims any listing inside the window and under your coin cap.
- Planner form to add custom targets with notes and a snipe cushion.
- Live countdown simulation with status chips for ready, waiting, and expired items.

## Running locally
1. From the repository root run `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
3. Interact with the **Auction snipes** tab to queue and test snipe scenarios.
